        <h4>About the Author</h4>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Alexis, and I'm an simi-active <a href="https://eu.battle.net/wow/en/">WoW</a> player, almost all my characters are called Senither, however  since there is a bit of a limit to how many different ways to can rearrange that one word, I came up with an anagram for it being Riseneth, and thus, this.. "thing" was born; Annyway.. So I got reallly bored and decided to make something, so this just sort of happened...
        </p>

        <h4>About the Project</h4>
        <p>
        The project was originally written in my own framework but has since then been updated to use <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, all the character data is fetched from <a href="https://dev.battle.net/">BattleNets public community API</a>.
